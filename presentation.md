## Legend

1. The basics, how would one go about writing validation code.
2. Getting fancier, previous solutions.
3. Enter generics.
4. Beyond type safety. What govy brings to the table?

## Simple checks

```go
~~~./code-to-slide.awk code/01-simple/main.go

~~~
```

---

## Simple checks with aggregate

```go
~~~./code-to-slide.awk code/02-simple-aggregate/main.go

~~~
```

---

## Simple checks with slice of students

```go
~~~./code-to-slide.awk code/02-simple-aggregate/main.go

~~~
```

## Simple approach summary

Things we could've done to improve it:

1. DRY, extract common functions for validating specific fields out.
2. 

Summary:

1. Works perfectly fine with simple structures.
2. Keeping consistent messages across multiple APIs can become a challenge.
3. What if our models' names change? Example: `Teacher.Name` --> `Teacher.FirstName`. Can we make sure messages reflect this change?
